# textpapegen
This bash script reads quotes and their authors from a text file, and for each quote makes a black wallpaper with the quote in white text on it.

To use, you need to install ImageMagick (https://imagemagick.org/index.php). 

The way I store my quotes is in plain text, with a quote on one line, the author on the line below it, then an empty line, then the next quote and so on.
The script works with this input format, so make sure you structure yours the same way.
See the etxt file sample-quotes.txt for the correct format. You can also use that file to test the script sraight away.
